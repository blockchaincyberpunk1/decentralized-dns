# DecentralizedDNS Smart Contract

## Summary
The DecentralizedDNS contract aims to provide a decentralized domain name system (DNS) solution on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to register domain names and associate them with resolver addresses, enabling decentralized resolution of domain names to Ethereum addresses.

### Features
- **Domain Registration**: Users can register domain names with associated resolver addresses.
- **Domain Update**: Owners can update the resolver address of their registered domains.
- **Domain Resolution**: Provides a function to resolve domain names to their associated resolver addresses.

## Note
The development of the DecentralizedDNS smart contract is still in progress. Further enhancements, testing, and integration with decentralized applications (dApps) are underway.
